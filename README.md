# Regression_with_insurance
As part of a machine learning mentorship, I participated in the Kaggle Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 12. The goal of this competition was to predict insurance premium amounts using a synthetic tabular dataset.

This challenge offered a great opportunity to apply and improve ML skills through data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Submissions were scored using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).

In this notebook, I document my approach, from data preprocessing to final model selection and performance.
